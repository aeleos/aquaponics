# aquaponics
Here is the code for my aquaponics system at school.
I am using a raspberry pi with Arturo in order to remotely upload code to the arduino. I am using the arduino as a hub for all of the sensors and
I plan on using some plugin to read the serial data into the webserver
The webserver will be hosted on the arduino and will be running mjpeg in order to view the ssytem from the webcam.
